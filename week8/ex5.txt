Physical address is real address that is present in hardware (in physical memory)

But Virtual address is an address for process, it may not be equal to the physical one
It may be greater than the size physical memory
The correlation between virtual and physical is up to MMU (Memory Managment Unit) 
MMU converts virtual address to the real one
