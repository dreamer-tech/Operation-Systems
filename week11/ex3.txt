The first program will print "Hello" 2 times
The second one will print it only once

It happens as while calling the system call fork() the program shares the buffer

In the first program we just add "Hello" to the buffer and make fork call, so the the child process has also "Hello" in its buffer, 
and then each process prints all out of its buffer after special character in printf '\n'

In the second program we print "Hello" immediately as it contains special character in the end - '\n' and clear the buffer

It works so as printf is a line buffer
